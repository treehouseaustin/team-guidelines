The following must be represented in this issue:

- [ ] Feature title which includes a persona, requested functionality, and business value.
- [ ] Each section in the template below should be filled out in as much detail as possible.
- [ ] The story should be blindly sized by at least two developers using a tool such as [Scrummy](http://playscrummy.com)

Stories which do not meet the above Definition of Ready criteria may still be created but must be tagged with `needs: definition` or `needs: sizing`

See [feature guidelines](./README.md#features) for additional details.

---

### Context

A brief description of the requested functionality from the persona or business value perspective. This should be written in language that a stakeholder can understand and should remain free of detailed technical implementation whenever possible. Sufficient context should be provided to any surrounding functionality to allow any team member to pick up the story without having to cross-reference other issues.

### How to Demo / Steps to Reproduce [choose one]

1. these steps represent acceptance criteria for the story: how to demo for features and steps to reproduce for bugs
2. this should remain free of highly technical instruction when possible so that a non-technical user can follow
3. for features, it's ideal if the how to demo is written from the perspective of the persona this story has been written for
4. for bugs, these steps should reliably (if possible) reproduce the bug and serve as acceptance criteria when the bug is fixed

### Development

- a bulleted list of details that are important to either the persona or the business in order for this feature to deliver value
- technical implementation or solution architecture, when it is specifically relevant to the feature, can be specified here
- additional context from a technical perspective can be bulleted here
- for a bug, this should outline the expected behavior and actual behavior to define the fix required
- naming expectations for model properties, variables, etc. should be clearly defined

### Questions

- any outstanding questions during sizing or story-writing should be captured here
- these can be answered inline and any requirements adjusted in the development section above

### Tasks

- [ ] a checklist to the developer representing the steps necessary to implement this story
- [ ] can be more technical in nature since these are developer-facing
- ** Known blockers can be called out in the task list and removed when satisfied**
- [ ] no single task should take longer than one day to complete
- [ ] the story assignee should attempt to limit tasks in progress the same way we limit stories in progress
- [ ] as each task is completed it should be checked off to provide high level status
- [ ] serves as a leading indicator to the progress made on this story
- [ ] this section can be removed for bugs and chores
