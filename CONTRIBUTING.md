# Contributing

Any development must have a corresponding story before work has begun on the implementation. This story can take the form of a feature, bug or chore. More information on the [Backlog](https://github.com/treehouseaustin/BACKLOG.md) and our feature development life cycle [can be found here](https://github.com/treehouseaustin/BACKLOG.md).

Overall development guidelines and agreed-upon conventions for this project should be observed at all times. More information on team guidelines can be found in the [team-guidelines](https://github.com/treehouseaustin/team-guidelines#development-guidelines) repository.
